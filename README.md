# Business-Data-Analytics-Project
In this project, I perform exploratory data analysis to find answers to these questions that will help the company to improve the business and also offer great recommendations and insights.

## About the project
The number of restaurants in New York is increasing day by day. Lots of students and busy professionals rely on those restaurants due to their hectic lifestyles. Online food delivery service is a great option for them. It provides them with good food from their favorite restaurants. A food aggregator company FoodHub offers access to multiple restaurants through a single smartphone app. The food aggregator company, Foodhub has stored the data of the different orders made by the registered customers in their online portal. They want to analyze the data to get a fair idea about the demand of different restaurants which will help them in enhancing their customer experience. They intend to analyze the data to draw some actionable insights for the business and have shared some of the key questions that need to be answered.
